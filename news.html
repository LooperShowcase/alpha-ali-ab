      Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect networks in larger geographic areas,
      such as Florida, the United States, or the world. Dedicated transoceanic
      cabling or satellite uplinks may be used to connect this type of global
      network. <br />
      Using a WAN, schools in Florida can communicate with places like Tokyo in
      a matter of seconds, without paying enormous phone bills. Two users a
      half-world apart with workstations equipped with microphones and a webcams
      might teleconference in real time. <br />
      A WAN is complicated. It uses multiplexers, bridges, and routers to
      connect local and metropolitan networks to global communications networks
      like the Internet. To users, however, a WAN will not appear to be much
      different than a LAN.

      In his notes, Chayefsky jotted down his ideas about casting. For Howard
      Beale, who would eventually be played by Peter Finch, he envisioned Henry
      Fonda, Cary Grant, James Stewart and Paul Newman. He went so far as to
      write Newman, telling him that "You and a very small handful of other
      actors are the only ones I can think of with the range for this part."
      <br />
      Lumet wanted Fonda, with whom he had worked several times, but Fonda
      declined the role, finding it too "hysterical" for his taste. Stewart also
      found the script unsuitable, objecting to the strong language. Early
      consideration was given to real-life newscasters Walter Cronkite and John
      Chancellor, but neither was open to the idea. Although not mentioned in
      Chayefsky's notes, George C. <br />
      Scott, Glenn Ford and William Holden reportedly also turned down the
      opportunity to play Beale, with Holden instead playing Max Schumacher: For
      that role, Chayefsky had initially listed Walter Matthau and Gene Hackman.
      Ford was under consideration for this part as well, and was said to be one
      of two final contenders. Holden finally got the edge because of his recent
      box-office success with The Towering Inferno.[14]
