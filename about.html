    <h1>about network</h1>
    <p>
      A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to
      share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow
      electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked
      through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared
      light beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computers connected to a network are broadly categorized as servers or
      workstations. <br />
      Servers are generally not used by humans directly, but rather run
      continuously to provide "services" to the other computers (and their human
      users) on the network. Services provided can include printing and faxing,
      software hosting, file storage and sharing, messaging, data storage and
      retrieval, complete access control (security) for the network's resources,
      and many others. <br />
      Workstations are called such because they typically do have a human user
      which interacts with the network through them. Workstations were
      traditionally considered a desktop, consisting of a computer, keyboard,
      display, and mouse, or a laptop, with with integrated keyboard, display,
      and touchpad. <br> With the advent of the tablet computer, and the touch screen
      devices such as iPad and iPhone, our definition of workstation is quickly
      evolving to include those devices, because of their ability to interact
      with the network and utilize network services. <br />
      Servers tend to be more powerful than workstations, although
      configurations are guided by needs. For example, a group of servers might
      be located in a secure area, away from humans, and only accessed through
      the network. <br />
      In such cases, it would be common for the servers to operate without a
      dedicated display or keyboard. However, the size and speed of the server's
      processor(s), hard drive, and main memory might add dramatically to the
      cost of the system. On the other hand, a workstation might not need as
      much storage or working memory, but might require an expensive display to
      accommodate the needs of its user.br Every computer on a network should be
      appropriately configured for its use. <br />
      On a single LAN, computers and servers may be connected by cables or
      wirelessly. Wireless access to a wired network is made possible by
      wireless access points (WAPs). These WAP devices provide a bridge between
      computers and networks. A typical WAP might have the theoretical capacity
      to connect hundreds or even thousands of wireless users to a network,
      although practical capacity might be far less. <br />
      Nearly always servers will be connected by cables to the network, because
      the cable connections remain the fastest. Workstations which are
      stationary (desktops) are also usually connected by a cable to the
      network, although the cost of wireless adapters has dropped to the point
      that, when installing workstations in an existing facility with inadequate
      wiring, it can be easier and less expensive to use wireless for a desktop.
